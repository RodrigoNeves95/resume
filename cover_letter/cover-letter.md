Dear hiring manager,

I'm writing to you to show my interest in your senior data science position. I believe that I cover all the requirements in the job application.

I have been working as a data scientist/machine learning engineer for the last four years in jungle.ai, a company in the energy and heavy industry sector with a focus on predictive maintenance and power forecasting. As an early joiner, I had the opportunity to work on several areas and challenges regarding data science going from data collection, data storing, data preparation, modelling, data visualization, product development, etc. This allowed me to go through all phases of a data science project, from an initial idea until the deployment in a live product to our clients!

With an electrical and computer engineering masters, where I started to understand the power of data and machine learning, I have a broad knowledge about different areas going from telecommunications until the power sector, that are always useful in everyday life!

I would like to thank you for the time to review my application!

Sincerely,

Rodrigo Neves
