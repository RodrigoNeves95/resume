    Currently working as a Software/Machine Learning enginer at a start-up with a focus on building predictive solutions for the energy
    and heavy industry sector. Having been working for 3+ years in a start-up, allowed me to learn, develop and broaden my knowledge and skills in several technical and non-technical areas at a pace that I was not expecting. Having been initially focused on expanding my machine learning skills all of the sudden I was already developing essential software to be used by my colleagues, creating fundamental internal dashboards, making
    presentations to our clients,
    deploying and managing business intelligence and machine learning workflows on a production cluster or jumping into Jungle's product source code to improve our backend backend or even fix a bug into the frontend with minimal experience on javascript. All of this allowed me to understand that I love to feel challenged and uncomfortable to keep myself motivated. I present myself as a person that is eager to learn, loves a good challenge, likes to ask questions, do not like inefficiencies, aims for excellence and is always ready to help.
